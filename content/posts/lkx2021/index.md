LeakIX v2 !

# Introducing reports

It has always been our target to help voluntary researchers and webmasters
keeping the Internet safer.

Next to each result you will now find a "create report" button, letting you
start a disclosure process to the involved parties :
![LeakIX reports](/lkx2021/search.png)

Should you choose to make the report public they'll be kept of history on our
report page : ![LeakIX reports](/lkx2021/report.png)

The best reporters will make the top and get a chance to enter our Trusted team
: ![LeakIX reports](/lkx2021/top.png)

## Revamped search results

- The search result page now makes better use of the screen space and displays
  smart filters on the left for a better navigation experience.
- Results now include hostnames, SSL hosts found, fingerprints (both JARM and
  LKX).
- Results now have ( a still optional ) severity ranking.
- If any ransom note is found in a database, it'll be displayed.

- New statistics screen
- OTP protection
- New plugins, including recent Confluence and Apache CVE
